    "The paper proposes a new multi-classification assessment model for personal credit risk based on the theory of information fusion (MIFCA) using six machine learning algorithms. The MIFCA model integrates the advantages of multiple classifiers and reduces the interference of uncertain information through Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory. The key contributions of the paper are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constructing a new multi-classification credit assessment model to provide more accurate five-classification credit assessments compared to traditional binary classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Innovatively fusing six different types of classifiers using D-S evidence theory to reduce uncertainty and improve overall accuracy and robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating a model with fewer parameters to enhance efficiency and usability, suitable for big data applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- Verifying the assessment performance of MIFCA on real datasets and comparing it with classic statistical and machine learning approaches."
